# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Implementing chunk-based WebSocket messaging to fix data corruption issues.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the memory bank.
- Updated the `projectbrief.md` file.
- Updated the `productContext.md` file.
- Removed the `sanitizeTextForWebSocket` function and padding from `tampermonkey-script.js`.
- Modified the `index.js` file to handle the WebSocket message as a string.
- Modified the `tampermonkey-script.js` file to send the data as a string.
- Added the padding back to the `tampermonkey-script.js` file.
- Modified the `index.js` file to explicitly use `utf8.decode` to decode the message.
- Fixed the WebSocket implementation in tampermonkey-script.js (version 17):
  - Added proper message handling in the connect() method
  - Created a dedicated processMessage() method
  - Improved error handling for WebSocket operations
  - Added socket state checking before sending messages
  - Enhanced logging for better debugging
- Fixed JSON serialization issues in index.js:
  - Modified sendRequest() to properly serialize and send WebSocket messages
  - Ensured properly formatted message object with stringified content
- Further improved tampermonkey-script.js (version 18):
  - Removed the padding from the message text
  - Simplified the message handling approach
  - Better alignment with the test case implementation
  - More consistent JSON object creation and serialization
- Implemented a chunk-based messaging approach:
  - On the client (tampermonkey-script.js): Split long messages into smaller chunks and send them separately
  - On the server (index.js): Added logic to collect and reassemble chunks before processing
  - Added detailed logging to track message transmission and chunk reassembly
  - Maintained backward compatibility with the existing API
- Improved browser compatibility for the Tampermonkey script:
  - Added support for Edge browser by enhancing input field detection
  - Used multiple selectors to reliably find the input field (`#prompt-textarea` and `div[contenteditable="true"]`)
  - Added support for multiple send button locators across different language interfaces
  - Enhanced debugging with more detailed logging of DOM elements
  - Added fallback mechanism to find elements by attributes and content
- Further enhanced the chunk-based messaging implementation:
  - Reduced chunk size from 1000 to 200 characters for more reliable transmission
  - Added time delays between sending chunks to prevent overwhelming the WebSocket
  - Added additional error handling for each chunk transmission
  - Improved logging with details of chunk content for better debugging
  - Added explicit asynchronous handling with proper wait sequences
- Completely overhauled tampermonkey-script.js to version 27:
  - Implemented exact icon-based generation status detection
  - Added direct targeting of the markdown prose element for complete content
  - Implemented structured content extraction with element-specific processing
  - Preserved proper formatting for paragraphs, code blocks, and list items
  - Ensured proper code block formatting with language detection and backticks
  - Added processing for all text content, not just the first section
  - Used proper content structure to maintain the original organization
  - Implemented element type detection to format each piece correctly
  - Maintained comprehensive fallback methods for Edge compatibility
  - Fixed HTML structure traversal to extract the complete message content
  - Fixed syntax error in WebSocket message handling (added missing try/catch)

- Fixed WebSocket encoding issue in index.js:
  - Removed utf8.decode that was causing encoding errors with French characters
  - Used direct string conversion instead of complex decoding
  - Fixed the "Invalid continuation byte" error while preserving functionality

## Next Steps
- Test the updated script on multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Continue to monitor for any remaining WebSocket transmission issues

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- None at this time.
