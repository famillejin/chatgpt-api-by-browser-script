# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Updating the memory bank.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the memory bank.
- Updated the `projectbrief.md` file.
- Updated the `productContext.md` file.
- Removed the `sanitizeTextForWebSocket` function and padding from `tampermonkey-script.js`.
- Modified the `index.js` file to handle the WebSocket message as a string.
- Modified the `tampermonkey-script.js` file to send the data as a string.
- Added the padding back to the `tampermonkey-script.js` file.
- Modified the `index.js` file to explicitly use `utf8.decode` to decode the message.

## Next Steps
- Investigate the websocket corrupting transmitted data error later.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
