# Progress

## What Works
- Basic setup of the project, including the Tampermonkey script, CSP disabler extension, and local Node.js server.

## What's Left to Build
- Full OpenAI API compatibility, including all the different API endpoints and parameters.

## Current Status
- The memory bank has been initialized and is being updated.
- Removed the `sanitizeTextForWebSocket` function and padding from `tampermonkey-script.js`.
- Modified the `index.js` file to handle the WebSocket message as a string.
- Modified the `tampermonkey-script.js` file to send the data as a string.
- Added the padding back to the `tampermonkey-script.js` file.
- Modified the `index.js` file to explicitly use `utf8.decode` to decode the message.
- Fixed the WebSocket implementation in tampermonkey-script.js (version 17):
  - Added robust message handling similar to test cases
  - Implemented proper type checking for received messages
  - Added state validation before sending messages
  - Created a dedicated processMessage() method for better error handling
  - Enhanced logging for easier debugging
- Fixed JSON serialization issues in index.js to properly format messages
- Further improved tampermonkey-script.js (version 18):
  - Removed padding that was causing data corruption
  - Simplified message handling approach
  - Used direct JSON object creation with proper serialization
  - Better aligned with working test cases
- Implemented a robust chunk-based WebSocket messaging system:
  - Client: Splits messages into smaller chunks (reduced to 200 characters each for better reliability)
  - Server: Collects and reassembles chunks to reconstruct the complete message
  - Added extensive logging to track message transmission and chunk reassembly
  - Added time delays between chunks (50ms) to prevent overwhelming the WebSocket
  - Implemented proper async/await pattern with error handling for each chunk
  - Added detailed logging of chunk content for better debugging
  - Ensured compatibility with existing API structures
- Enhanced browser compatibility for different environments:
  - Added support for Microsoft Edge by improving input field detection
  - Implemented multiple selector strategies to reliably locate input fields
  - Added support for different language interfaces with multiple send button selectors
  - Added fallback mechanisms to find UI elements by their attributes and content
  - Enhanced error logging with detailed information about available DOM elements
- Completely overhauled content extraction (version 27):
  - Implemented a comprehensive element-by-element content extraction
  - Added direct targeting of the markdown prose container to capture all content
  - Processed paragraphs, code blocks, and list items separately with proper formatting
  - Used element-specific formatting to maintain the correct structure
  - Preserved code blocks with proper language detection and backtick formatting
  - Added support for list items with proper bullet point formatting
  - Combined all content types with appropriate spacing for readability
  - Maintained robust fallbacks for different browser DOM structures
  - Applied a structured approach that extracts the entire conversation
  - Fixed truncation issues that were missing content after the first code block
  - Fixed syntax error in WebSocket message handler causing crash in browser

- Fixed WebSocket encoding issues:
  - Removed utf8.decode from index.js that was causing errors with special characters
  - Used direct string conversion for message handling
  - Fixed the "Invalid continuation byte" error that occurred with French text
  - Maintained all functionality while resolving character encoding problems

## Known Issues
- The previous WebSocket data corruption issue (where portions of text were lost during transmission) should now be resolved by:
  1. Fixing JSON serialization in the server side (index.js)
  2. Improving message handling in the client side (tampermonkey-script.js)
  3. Implementing a chunk-based approach that avoids WebSocket frame size limitations
  4. Adding more robust error handling and message reassembly
- The streaming response truncation issue should now be resolved with the new chunked message handling approach.
